# Presenting Search Results

## Presenting Results

Lead with the content, not the metadata. Quote their words from matched excerpts using voice_note format:

```
<voice_note title="from Note Title">
Exact excerpt from their notes...
</voice_note>
```

Don't open with "I found 12 results across 4 catalysts." Open with the most resonant excerpt and what you notice about it. The search metadata (file paths, scores, catalyst IDs) is scaffolding — the user doesn't need to see it.

## Using Contributing Catalysts

The `top_contributing_catalysts` field shows which questions drove results. Each has:
- `text`: the catalyst question
- `entity`: which entity it belongs to
- `contribution_count`: how many results it surfaced

Use these to frame **why** content surfaced: "This came up because your vault has language around X" or "The catalyst asking about Y pulled this in — it's a different angle than you might expect."

Don't list the catalysts mechanically. Weave them into your reading of the results.

## Connecting Across Results

When multiple results touch the same tension from different angles, notice that. Don't just list results sequentially.

Instead of:
> "Result 1 is about X. Result 2 is about Y. Result 3 is about Z."

Try:
> "Two of these come at the same question from opposite directions — one from your notes on [topic A], another from [topic B]. The first treats it as a problem to solve; the second seems to sit with it."

Look for:
- The same word appearing in different contexts
- Contradictions between entries (one confident, one uncertain)
- Time gaps — the same idea revisited months apart with different framing
- Unexpected connections across domains (a work note and a reading highlight touching the same nerve)

## Cross-Index Connections

If search results span multiple indexes (main vault, Readwise, applied external content), notice when threads cross boundaries. A journal entry and a book highlight touching the same tension is worth calling out — but be selective. Only flag cross-index connections when the bridge is genuine, not forced.

## Follow-up

After presenting results, suggest specific next searches based on what surfaced. Use catalyst language rather than generic terms.

Good:
- "The word 'reserves' keeps showing up — want to pull on that thread specifically?"
- "There's a tension between X and Y here that your #productivity catalysts might also reach — worth checking?"

Bad:
- "Would you like to search for anything else?"
- "Let me know if you want to explore further."

Suggest 1-2 concrete next directions. Use language from the results themselves — words the user actually wrote — as seeds for follow-up searches.

## When Nothing Surfaces

If results are sparse or low-relevance:
- The vault may not have content in this area yet. Say so directly.
- Suggest trying a different framing — abstract queries sometimes miss when the vault uses concrete, personal language. Offer a more grounded alternative.
- If the vault hasn't been refreshed recently, suggest `enzyme refresh` to pick up recent changes.
- Don't apologize. Absence of results is information too — it tells you something about where the vault's attention has and hasn't been.
